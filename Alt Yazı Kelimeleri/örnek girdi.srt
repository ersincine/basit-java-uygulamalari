1
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:30,445
They say Japan was made
by a sword.

2
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,991
They say the old gods dipped
a coral blade into the ocean...

3
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:40,954
...and when they pulled it out, four
perfect drops fell back into the sea...

4
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,583
...and those drops became
the islands of Japan.

5
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:50,671
I say Japan was made
by a handful of brave men...

6
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:54,759
...warriors willing to give their lives...

7
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:57,636
...for what seems to have become
a forgotten word:

8
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,305
Honor.

9
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:59,067
Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.

10
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:01,820
America's leader in all forms
of armament used...

11
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,530
...by the United States Army...

12
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:08,618
...celebrates our nation's centennial
by bringing you a true American hero.

13
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:13,873
One of the most decorated warriors
this country has ever known.

14
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,792
Winner of the Medal of Honor
for his gallantry...

15
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,211
...on the hallowed ground
of Gettysburg.

16
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:20,671
San Francisco, 1876

17
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:23,673
He is late of the 7th Cavalry...

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,969
...and their triumphant campaign against
the most savage of the Indian nations.

19
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:32,473
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you:

20
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,768
Captain Nathan Algren!

21
00:02:42,899 --> 00:02:47,195
Captain Nathan Algren!

22
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:49,197
Yes!

23
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:50,656
Yes!

24
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,744
One moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,790
Goddamn you, Algren,
get out there!

26
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:04,169
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!

27
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:08,298
Come on! I'm sick of this!

28
00:03:08,506 --> 00:03:09,799
Come on!

29
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,385
Yes!

30
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:23,395
My thanks, Mr. McCabe,
you are too kind.

31
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,066
This, ladies and gents...

32
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:31,319
...is the gun that's winning the West.

33
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:34,655
Why, many's the time
I've found myself...

34
00:03:36,657 --> 00:03:39,910
...surrounded by a swarm of...

35
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,122
...angry hostiles...

36
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,958
...with nothing but this rifle...

37
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:51,796
...between me and a certain
and gruesome death.

38
00:03:52,463 --> 00:03:55,257
And let me tell you, folks,
the red man...

39
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:58,469
...is a fearsome enemy.

40
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:00,429
And if he'd had his way...

41
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:03,932
...why, this scalp of mine
would be long gone...

42
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:07,685
...and there'd be a balder man
standing before you today.

43
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:16,151
Like those poor bastards out there...

44
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,946
...on the Little Bighorn.

45
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:23,200
Bodies stripped bare...

46
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:26,286
...mutilated.

47
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,039
Left to rot in the sun.

48
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,630
This, ladies and gentlemen,
the 73 lever-action...

49
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,632
...Trapper.

50
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:45,387
It's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.

51
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,932
Son, have you ever seen
what this could do to a man?

52
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:51,976
This would blow a hole
in your daddy six inches wide.

53
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:53,477
That's right, missy.

54
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,521
This beauty.

55
00:04:55,688 --> 00:05:00,192
You could kill yourself five, six, seven
braves without ever having to reload.

56
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:04,237
Note the patented loading port
and the smooth cocking action.

57
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:24,214
My thanks on behalf
of those who died...

58
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:28,009
...in the name of better
mechanical amusements...

59
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:30,511
...and commercial opportunities.

60
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:34,181
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.

61
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,684
God bless you all.

62
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:47,694
I must say, captain, you have a flair
for the old melodrama.

63
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:51,197
- You're alive.
- I am, indeed.

64
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:55,451
Your man Custer says to me,
"We're going to the Little Bighorn."

65
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:59,037
Says I, "What's this 'we' stuff?"
It's the walking ticket for me.

66
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:01,998
Nine lives I have.
But I'll tell you what else I have.

67
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:04,167
I have a good job for the both of us.

68
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:07,003
God knows it looks
as if you'll need one real soon.

69
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,213
What kind of a job?

70
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,176
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.

71
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:19,223
Unless, of course, you got your heart
set on a career in the theater.

72
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:24,936
Nathan!

73
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:27,397
Just listen to what
your man has to say.

74
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:29,565
Been a while.
It's good to see you.

75
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:32,693
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan...

76
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,697
...and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.

77
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,157
Sit down, please.

78
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:45,246
Whiskey.

79
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:50,877
Now, Japan's got it in mind
to become a civilized country.

80
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,921
And Mr. Omura here is willing
to spend what it takes...

81
00:06:54,088 --> 00:06:56,757
...to hire white experts
to train their army.

82
00:06:56,924 --> 00:06:58,926
And if we play our cards right...

83
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:02,721
...the Emperor grants the U.S.
Exclusive rights to supply arms.

84
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:12,605
Well, I have an agreement
with Winchester Company.

85
00:07:12,772 --> 00:07:16,066
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept
of what an agreement is.

86
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:21,655
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.

87
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:24,491
We will pay you $400 a month.

88
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:32,039
Five. For each.

89
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:36,710
And another 500
when we get the job done.

90
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:41,757
How many other genuine heroes
you got lined up?

91
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,968
He's rude.

92
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:48,429
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.

93
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,139
Whiskey.

94
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:53,184
So who will we be training
your boys to fight?

95
00:07:53,642 --> 00:07:57,938
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.

96
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:01,274
- He's Samurai.
- Samurai?

97
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:03,777
The word you might use is "warrior."

98
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:07,530
Mr. Omura is familiar with our
experiences dealing with renegades.

99
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:09,615
Is he?

100
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:11,450
He's even read your book.

101
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,744
Captain Algren's study of the tribes...

102
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,830
...was a crucial factor
in our defeat of the Cheyenne.

103
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,762
Please excuse. What is funny?

104
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:39,518
The corps back together again.
It's just so...

105
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:42,729
...inspiring!

106
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,402
Excuse me.

107
00:08:52,363 --> 00:08:54,949
I need to use the necessities.

108
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,538
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.

109
00:09:01,705 --> 00:09:03,206
Colonel Bagley.

110
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:06,960
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer...

111
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:09,587
...and you assured us
of his participation.

112
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:13,007
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.

113
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:16,927
Nathan.

114
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,723
I did what I was ordered
to do out there.

115
00:09:22,224 --> 00:09:23,767
And I have no remorse.

116
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:27,812
So, what do you say we
put the past behind us?

117
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:34,860
You want me to kill Jappos,
I'll kill them.

118
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:38,072
- I'm not asking you to kill anybody.
- You want me to kill their enemies...

119
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:39,781
...I'll kill their enemies.

120
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:43,660
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne...

121
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:47,330
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.

122
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:49,916
But keep one thing in mind...

123
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,336
...I'd happily kill you for free.

124
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:12,728
July 12th, 1876.

125
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,481
There is some comfort
in the emptiness of the sea.

126
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:20,110
No past, no future.

127
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:26,324
And then at once, I am confronted by
the hard truth of present circumstances.

128
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:34,665
I have been hired to help suppress
the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.

129
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:38,585
Apparently, this is the only job
for which I am suited.

130
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:44,841
I am beset by the ironies of my life.

131
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:21,416
Yokohama Harbor, 1876

132
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,408
- Captain Algren, I presume?
- Yes.

133
00:11:57,574 --> 00:12:00,035
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.

134
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,705
Twenty years ago,
this was a sleepy little town.

135
00:12:03,872 --> 00:12:05,206
Now look at it.

136
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:08,585
You see, the Emperor is mad
for all things Western...

137
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,796
...and the Samurai believe
it's changing too fast.

138
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:15,049
The ancient and the modern
are at war for the soul of Japan.

139
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,218
So your new employer, Mr. Omura,
is bringing in...

140
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,596
...every Western expert he can get.

141
00:12:20,762 --> 00:12:24,683
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland...

142
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:28,269
...and now, of course,
warriors from America.

143
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:33,024
I came over with the British
trade mission, oh, years ago.

144
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,067
I was soon relieved of my position.

145
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:37,820
I had an unfortunate tendency
to tell the truth...

146
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:40,781
...in a country where no one ever
says what they mean.

147
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:45,327
So now, I very accurately translate
other people's lies.

148
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,793
For 2000 years, no emperor
was even seen by a commoner.

149
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:58,547
You have to realize what an honor this
is. It's all highly ritualized, of course.

150
00:12:58,714 --> 00:13:01,591
You may look at him,
but do not speak unless spoken to.

151
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:05,762
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.

152
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,973
Do I look presentable?
I haven't worn this in a decade.

153
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:12,310
Rather snug around the midriff.

154
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,325
And bow.

155
00:13:30,618 --> 00:13:33,537
The divine Emperor Meiji
bids you welcome.

156
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:36,957
He is grateful for the assistance
your country offers.

157
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:40,210
We hope to accomplish
the same national harmony...

158
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:42,796
...you enjoy in your homeland.

159
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,556
The Emperor is most interested
in your American Indians...

160
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:56,141
...if you have fought
against them in battle.

161
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:59,436
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.

162
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:10,113
The Emperor wishes
to ask Captain Algren...

163
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,990
...if it is true they wear eagle feathers...

164
00:14:13,157 --> 00:14:16,201
...and paint their faces
before going into battle...

165
00:14:16,368 --> 00:14:18,579
...and that they have no fear.

166
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:23,500
They are very brave.

167
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,592
Bow.

168
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:45,186
Thank you very much.

169
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:58,907
And step back.

170
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:04,537
Step back, step back and turn.

171
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:10,001
Right, you little bastards!

172
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:13,838
You will stand up straight
or I will personally shit-kick...

173
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:17,508
...every Far Eastern buttock
that appears before my eyes!

174
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:21,386
Well done, sergeant.

175
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,764
When you understand the language,
everything falls into place.

176
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:27,767
The first rank will kneel,
rifles at the ready.

177
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,353
The second rank...

178
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,522
July 22nd, 1876.

179
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:38,944
For six months ' work, I am to receive
three years of captain's pay...

180
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:41,738
...teaching Orientals to soldier.

181
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:45,950
They are an army of conscripts.

182
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:49,120
Most of them are peasants
who have never even seen a gun.

183
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,913
Fire!

184
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,584
They are led by General Hasegawa,
a man of small stature...

185
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:58,545
...who nonetheless commands
enormous respect.

186
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:02,716
What can the general tell me about
this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?

187
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:11,307
He seems to have great knowledge
of Katsumoto and his rebellion.

188
00:16:11,474 --> 00:16:14,018
I will count on his help
when facing the Samurai.

189
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:16,020
Who supplies their weapons?

190
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:27,655
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself
by using firearms, you see.

191
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:29,824
He uses no firearms?

192
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:32,910
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.

193
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,829
How well does he know him?

194
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,248
The general and Katsumoto
fought together for the Emperor.

195
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,833
He fought with the Samurai?

196
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,753
He is Samurai.

197
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,512
You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword...

198
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,972
...to defend the Emperor.

199
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,766
They say that a Samurai's sword
is his soul.

200
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,643
Samurai are paradoxical.

201
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,771
I've tried to write about them,
but they keep to themselves.

202
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,482
The bastards are still wearing armor.

203
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:08,818
When the Irish were comporting
themselves in loincloths...

204
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:12,196
...these chaps were the most
sophisticated warriors on Earth.

205
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,490
I need information
on their battle tactics.

206
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:17,826
I have several more books
just waiting to be translated.

207
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,162
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.

208
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,414
You should hear him blather on
in Blackfoot.

209
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,082
Really?

210
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:27,043
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!

211
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,463
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.

212
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,175
Just "hello" or "goodbye" or-
No, no, no!

213
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,802
"Cut his tongue out
and boil him in oil."

214
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,348
Early day tomorrow, captain.

215
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:45,352
- It's about bedtime, isn't it?
- I always had a fascination with scalping.

216
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:48,354
I never quite understood
its technique.

217
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:57,905
Imagine someone who hates you
with the utmost intensity...

218
00:17:58,197 --> 00:18:03,076
...grabbing a handful of your hair while
you're lying prostrate and helpless...

219
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:12,460
...and scraping a dull blade
of a rusty knife around your scalp...

220
00:18:12,627 --> 00:18:14,920
...with a saw-like motion.

221
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:20,717
And let your imagination grasp, if you
can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk...

222
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:25,388
...on the turf of your hair
to release any clinging particles...

223
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:28,308
...would have on your nervous system.

224
00:18:32,353 --> 00:18:36,232
And you'll have some idea
of how it feels to be scalped...

225
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,859
...Mr. Graham.

226
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,533
How soon can you
translate those books?

227
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,745
Right away.

228
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:56,333
I'm just delighted you're taking
such an interest in Samurai.

229
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,920
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.

230
00:19:00,087 --> 00:19:03,507
I shall not sleep until it is done.

231
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:07,760
Sake.

232
00:19:08,428 --> 00:19:10,263
I bid you good night.

233
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:12,598
Can I get you anything?

234
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,809
This is a punitive expedition, captain.

235
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:18,145
Col. Bagley, these people had
nothing to do with the raids!

236
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:20,939
- Good night, sir.
- Quietly now, boys.

237
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:07,899
Fire!

238
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,744
We should be grateful they're all firing
in the same direction.

239
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:23,163
Couldn't have put it better myself, sir.

240
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,919
Rifle butt, against the shoulder.

241
00:20:31,671 --> 00:20:34,131
Eye, down the sight.

242
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:36,008
Now, slowly...

243
00:20:41,013 --> 00:20:42,514
Well done.

244
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,392
Nathan!

245
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:52,523
Katsumoto's attacked a railroad
at the border of his province.

246
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,860
We cannot govern a country
in which we cannot travel freely.

247
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,319
He must be stopped now.

248
00:20:57,486 --> 00:21:01,114
My railroad is a priority
for this country.

249
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:02,574
They're not ready.

250
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:06,536
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.

251
00:21:06,744 --> 00:21:10,373
Whose sole occupation for the last
thousand years has been war.

252
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,293
You have superior firepower
and a larger force.

253
00:21:15,044 --> 00:21:18,005
I am ordering the regiment
to move against Katsumoto.

254
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:21,508
You will track him down
and engage him.

255
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:26,346
Load.

256
00:21:26,513 --> 00:21:29,891
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!

257
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:33,561
- I beg your pardon?
- Tell this man...

258
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:37,272
...if he does not shoot me,
I will kill him!

259
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:41,568
- Captain, if I might have a word.
- Tell him!

260
00:21:43,111 --> 00:21:44,738
Tell him!

261
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,411
Load!

262
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:58,083
Load!

263
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,379
Faster!

264
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:04,965
Faster!

265
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,929
Shoot me, damn it.

266
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,102
Fire!

267
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:21,355
Fire!

268
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,213
They're not ready.

269
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,635
The regiment leaves at 6 a. M!

270
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:29,625
A thousand miles of rail track laid
in less than two years.

271
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,460
It's astonishing.

272
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,713
And Omura owns all of it?

273
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,882
As soon as he can get rid
of the Samurai, he will, yes.

274
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,593
How do you intend
to find Katsumoto?

275
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,306
Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'll find us.

276
00:23:55,316 --> 00:23:56,609
Move into position!

277
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,068
Yoshino Province, 1876

278
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,570
1 st Company,
form a battle line on me!

279
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,739
Pay attention,
it will save your life!

280
00:24:02,906 --> 00:24:05,533
2nd Company,
form on 1 st Company.

281
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,036
3rd and 4th Company,
form up behind.

282
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:09,746
Fill in on command!

283
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:13,749
- Where's Hasegawa?
- He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.

284
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,712
- Cover down!
- Captain Algren.

285
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,381
We are not here as combatants.

286
00:24:21,548 --> 00:24:24,175
- Then who's gonna lead them?
- Their own officers.

287
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:27,137
- Let's move to the rear.
- We'll be there presently.

288
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:28,846
Fix bayonets!

289
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,479
- Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
- Yes, of course.

290
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:47,197
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see
to the disposition of the supply trains.

291
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:50,241
- Did you hear my order?
- I did indeed, sir!

292
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,743
Then you will obey it. Now!

293
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:56,288
No disrespect intended, sir,
but shove it up your ass.

294
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,254
- Load!
- Load!

295
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:33,322
Samurai come.

296
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:36,575
You'll be fine, son.

297
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:57,177
- Assume firing positions!
- Assume firing positions!

298
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:13,192
Fire on my order only!

299
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,338
Hold your fire!

300
00:26:37,506 --> 00:26:39,049
Hold your fire!

301
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,098
Reload!

302
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,145
Hold the line!

303
00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:56,649
Fire at will!

304
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:14,206
Lieutenant, fall back!

305
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:58,997
Zeb!

306
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:41,174
He's mine.

307
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:09,742
Stop!

308
00:30:17,374 --> 00:30:19,126
Take him away!

309
00:32:26,117 --> 00:32:27,493
What is your name?

310
00:32:29,829 --> 00:32:31,581
Insolent swine! Answer!

311
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,386
Leave him be.

312
00:32:55,436 --> 00:32:57,229
This is my son's village.

313
00:32:57,396 --> 00:33:01,108
We are deep in the mountains and
winter is coming. You cannot escape.

314
00:33:04,235 --> 00:33:06,029
Jolly good.

315
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,144
My Lord, why do you spare
the barbarian?

316
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,897
He is shamed in defeat.

317
00:35:15,856 --> 00:35:17,483
He should kill himself.

318
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,943
That is not their custom.

319
00:35:24,447 --> 00:35:25,907
Then...

320
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:28,159
...I will kill him.

321
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:29,911
Father...

322
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,871
I don't think...

323
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:35,749
Ujio...

324
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,836
...there will be plenty of killing to come.

325
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:40,629
For now...

326
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:43,548
...we will learn about our new enemy.

327
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:45,925
Keep him alive.

328
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,060
He's in bad shape.

329
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:58,812
Sake.

330
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,023
Sake?

331
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:04,484
Sake.

332
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,159
Sake.

333
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:15,202
Taka will take care of you.

334
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:16,954
Sake.

335
00:37:16,925 --> 00:37:18,510
Sake.

336
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:22,305
Sake!

337
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:25,100
Let him drink, Aunt.

338
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,060
No. That will not do.

339
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:28,478
This is my village.

340
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,771
This is my house.

341
00:37:35,568 --> 00:37:36,986
Please.

342
00:37:37,403 --> 00:37:38,904
Sake.

343
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,998
Sake!

344
00:37:57,463 --> 00:38:00,299
No!

345
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:03,552
No!

346
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:10,433
I told you!

347
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,733
No!

348
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,858
Morning.

349
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,669
Over there!

350
00:40:58,003 --> 00:41:00,672
Go. You, go.

351
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:03,800
What's your name?

352
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,261
You got a name, don't you?

353
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:12,642
You don't know what I'm saying,
do you?

354
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,519
I know why you don't talk.

355
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:18,522
You're angry.

356
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:21,733
You're angry because
they make you wear a dress.

357
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:24,569
Son of a bitch.

358
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,525
This temple was built by my family
a thousand years ago.

359
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,488
My name is Katsumoto.

360
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,533
What is your name?

361
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:24,332
Are my words not correct?

362
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:31,756
I will practice my English with you...

363
00:42:33,215 --> 00:42:35,092
...if you would honor me.

364
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:39,054
You kept me alive just to speak English?

365
00:42:41,223 --> 00:42:43,058
Then what do you want?

366
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,643
To know my enemy.

367
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:49,897
I've seen what you do to your enemies.

368
00:42:50,231 --> 00:42:52,233
Warriors in your country do not kill?

369
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,653
They don't cut the heads off defeated,
kneeling men.

370
00:42:56,695 --> 00:43:00,407
General Hasegawa asked me
to help him end his life.

371
00:43:01,908 --> 00:43:05,286
A Samurai cannot stand
the shame of defeat.

372
00:43:06,037 --> 00:43:08,247
I was honored to cut off his head.

373
00:43:11,292 --> 00:43:16,130
Many of our customs seem strange
to you. The same is true of yours.

374
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:17,840
For example...

375
00:43:18,006 --> 00:43:22,969
...not to introduce yourself is considered
extremely rude, even among enemies.

376
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,561
Nathan Algren.

377
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:36,482
I am honored to meet you.

378
00:43:37,107 --> 00:43:41,028
- I enjoyed this conversation in English.
- I have questions.

379
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:44,864
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.

380
00:43:45,031 --> 00:43:47,158
This is a very good conversation.

381
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:49,744
- I have questions.
- They come later.

382
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,288
Who was the warrior in the red armor?

383
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:56,959
- My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
- And the woman who cares for me?

384
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,962
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.

385
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:01,713
Her name is Taka.

386
00:44:02,005 --> 00:44:03,298
I killed her husband?

387
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:07,427
It was a good death.

388
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:21,690
You!

389
00:44:21,857 --> 00:44:26,152
You! Come... Please...

390
00:44:55,471 --> 00:44:56,764
Thank you.

391
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:09,192
He smells like the pigs.
Tell my brother I cannot stand this.

392
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,693
Why don't you tell him?

393
00:45:10,943 --> 00:45:12,903
At least make him take a bath.

394
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,174
Nicely done.

395
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:26,471
They may be children,
but they are strong.

396
00:46:26,638 --> 00:46:27,931
You try.

397
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:30,349
Try.

398
00:47:10,803 --> 00:47:12,096
Put down the sword.

399
00:49:39,606 --> 00:49:43,818
I just realized, I've been remiss.
Forgive me.

400
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:47,614
I have yet to thank you
for looking out for me yesterday.

401
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:50,158
That is your job, correct?

402
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,285
Protecting me?

403
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,287
Well done, Bob.

404
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:58,123
You don't mind if I call you "Bob,"
do you?

405
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:02,752
I knew a Bob once.
God, he was ugly as a mule.

406
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:05,672
You a ladies' man, Bob?

407
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:13,471
Ujio is teaching you the way
of the Japanese sword.

408
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:16,890
Yes, indeed.

409
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:22,479
You fought against your Red Indians?

410
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,443
Yes.

411
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,361
Tell me of your part in this war.

412
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,113
- Why?
- I wish to learn.

413
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,616
- Read a book.
- I would rather have a good conversation.

414
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,826
- Why?
- Because...

415
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,870
...we are both students of war.

416
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,753
So...

417
00:50:50,004 --> 00:50:52,548
...you were the general of your army?

418
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:56,427
No.

419
00:50:57,636 --> 00:51:00,055
I was a captain.

420
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:02,516
This is a low rank?

421
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:06,686
A middle rank.

422
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:09,272
And who was your general?

423
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:16,820
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?

424
00:51:16,987 --> 00:51:20,324
People in your country
do not like conversation?

425
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:22,909
He was a lieutenant colonel.

426
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:25,286
His name was Custer.

427
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:26,746
I know this name.

428
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:29,207
He killed many warriors.

429
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:31,042
Oh, yes. Many warriors.

430
00:51:31,209 --> 00:51:33,377
So he was a good general.

431
00:51:33,544 --> 00:51:37,089
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.

432
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:41,635
He got massacred because he took
a battalion against 2000 angry Indians.

433
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:44,554
Two thousand Indians?

434
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,264
How many men for Custer?

435
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:48,099
Two hundred and eleven.

436
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,519
I like this General Custer.

437
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:56,106
He was a murderer who fell in love
with his own legend.

438
00:51:56,273 --> 00:51:58,400
And his troopers died for it.

439
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,652
I think this is a very good death.

440
00:52:00,819 --> 00:52:02,821
Maybe you can have one
like it someday.

441
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:05,156
If it is in my destiny.

442
00:52:06,074 --> 00:52:09,118
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want for yourself?

443
00:52:11,746 --> 00:52:13,164
What are you doing?

444
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,457
Why are we having these conversations?

445
00:52:16,208 --> 00:52:18,585
What the hell am I doing here?

446
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:25,341
In spring...

447
00:52:25,508 --> 00:52:28,928
...the snows will melt
and the passes will open.

448
00:52:30,763 --> 00:52:33,432
Until that time, you are here.

449
00:52:35,267 --> 00:52:38,020
Good day, captain.

450
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:00,874
1876.

451
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,252
Day unknown. Month unknown.

452
00:53:05,295 --> 00:53:08,965
I continue to live among
these unusual people.

453
00:53:10,216 --> 00:53:13,427
I am their captive,
in that I cannot escape.

454
00:53:15,387 --> 00:53:18,098
Mostly, I'm treated with
a kind of a mild neglect...

455
00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:23,603
...as if I were a stray dog
or an unwelcome guest.

456
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:38,408
Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.

457
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,789
But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.

458
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:27,078
They are an intriguing people.

459
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,205
From the moment they wake...

460
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:33,376
...they devote themselves to
the perfection of whatever they pursue.

461
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:44,886
I have never seen such discipline.

462
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:50,099
I am surprised to learn that the word
"Samurai" means "to serve"...

463
00:54:50,266 --> 00:54:52,768
...and that Katsumoto believes
his rebellion to be...

464
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:54,854
...in the service of the Emperor.

465
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:59,343
Please forgive. Too many mind.

466
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:02,554
Too many mind?

467
00:57:03,096 --> 00:57:07,392
Mind sword, mind people watch,
mind enemy.

468
00:57:08,226 --> 00:57:10,019
Too many mind.

469
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:13,272
No mind.

470
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:16,859
No mind.

471
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:49,097
Thank you. More rice?

472
00:57:50,765 --> 00:57:54,101
Taka. He spoke Japanese!

473
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:58,105
Eat a lot. Don't be polite.

474
00:57:58,564 --> 00:58:00,941
Not so fast. What are these?

475
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:07,614
How can he understand?

476
00:58:11,117 --> 00:58:12,660
Top knot.

477
00:58:16,914 --> 00:58:18,290
No, no. Not so fast.

478
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,753
I'm Algren.

479
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,346
- Nobutada.
- Nobutada.

480
00:58:35,055 --> 00:58:36,974
- Magojiro.
- Magojiro.

481
00:58:37,141 --> 00:58:38,433
Higen.

482
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:40,435
Higen.

483
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:45,356
Taka.

484
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:51,988
Brother, please make him leave.
I cannot stand it.

485
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,198
Is he so repulsive?

486
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:57,618
The shame is unbearable.
I ask permission to end my life.

487
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,120
You will do as you are told!

488
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,128
You'd rather I kill him
to avenge your husband?

489
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,922
Yes.

490
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:17,761
Hirotaro tried to kill the American.
It was karma.

491
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:19,554
I know.

492
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,185
Forgive my weakness.

493
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:29,772
There must be some reason
why he is here.

494
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,486
It is beyond my understanding.

495
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,547
She's been very kind to me.

496
00:59:57,506 --> 01:00:01,510
She's honored to have
my guest in her house.

497
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:28,660
Winter, 1877.

498
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,537
What does it mean to be Samurai?

499
01:00:31,704 --> 01:00:35,124
To devote yourself utterly
to a set of moral principles...

500
01:00:35,874 --> 01:00:38,752
...to seek a stillness of your mind...

501
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:42,631
...and to master the way of the sword.

502
01:00:42,797 --> 01:00:44,424
He's getting better, no?

503
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:48,428
But still so ugly.

504
01:00:57,144 --> 01:00:58,520
Cold?

505
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:11,699
Also. Also cold.

506
01:01:12,742 --> 01:01:14,076
Fire.

507
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:24,252
To burn.

508
01:01:42,644 --> 01:01:44,229
No, please.

509
01:01:46,105 --> 01:01:48,858
Japanese men do not help with this.

510
01:01:49,317 --> 01:01:52,611
I am not Japanese.

511
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:24,432
I'm sorry.

512
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,902
For your husband, Hirotaro.

513
01:02:49,747 --> 01:02:54,543
He did his duty.

514
01:02:58,213 --> 01:03:02,175
You did your duty.

515
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,891
I accept your apology...

516
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,036
Spring, 1877.

517
01:03:32,453 --> 01:03:37,416
This marks the longest I have stayed
in one place since I left the farm at 17.

518
01:03:40,919 --> 01:03:44,255
There is so much here
that I'll never understand.

519
01:03:48,634 --> 01:03:51,429
I have never been a church-going man...

520
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:53,889
...and what I've seen
on the field of battle...

521
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:56,016
...has led me to question God's purpose.

522
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:58,560
But there is, indeed, something...

523
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:01,772
...spiritual in this place.

524
01:04:05,066 --> 01:04:08,528
And though it may forever
be obscure to me...

525
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:12,156
...I cannot but be aware of its power.

526
01:04:20,622 --> 01:04:25,585
I do know it is here that I have known
my first untroubled sleep in many years.

527
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:31,882
No, you gotta get the ball!
Go and get it.

528
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:36,178
No, not me!
You gotta get the ball! The ball!

529
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:46,896
Ujio will win in three moves.

530
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:51,150
In five!

531
01:05:05,622 --> 01:05:07,081
Next in five moves.

532
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:10,418
In six.

533
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,187
No mind.

534
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,540
A draw!

535
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:23,748
Who is this amateur?

536
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:28,141
Katsumoto!

537
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,396
Protect Katsumoto!
Protect our Lord!

538
01:09:13,224 --> 01:09:14,642
Lord, please go inside!

539
01:11:55,164 --> 01:11:58,458
The perfect blossom is a rare thing.

540
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:03,672
You could spend your life looking for
one, and it would not be a wasted life.

541
01:12:04,464 --> 01:12:06,466
Who sent those men to kill you?

542
01:12:06,633 --> 01:12:09,719
I'm writing a poem about a dream I had.

543
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:13,097
The tiger's eyes are like my own

544
01:12:13,264 --> 01:12:16,475
But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea

545
01:12:17,392 --> 01:12:19,228
Was it the Emperor?

546
01:12:21,063 --> 01:12:22,355
Omura?

547
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:26,442
If the Emperor wishes my death,
he has but to ask.

548
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,195
So it was Omura.

549
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,948
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.

550
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,784
- Can you suggest a last line?
- I'm not a writer.

551
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:41,039
Yet you have written many pages
since you came here.

552
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,668
What else has she told you?

553
01:12:47,545 --> 01:12:49,589
You have nightmares.

554
01:12:52,425 --> 01:12:53,968
Every soldier has nightmares.

555
01:12:54,135 --> 01:12:57,596
Only one who is ashamed
of what he has done.

556
01:12:58,347 --> 01:13:01,558
You have no idea what I have done.

557
01:13:08,815 --> 01:13:11,984
You have seen many things.

558
01:13:12,777 --> 01:13:14,069
I have.

559
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:18,448
And you do not fear death,
but sometimes you wish for it.

560
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:21,034
Is this not so?

561
01:13:23,578 --> 01:13:26,164
- Yes.
- I, also.

562
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:31,127
It happens to men who have seen
what we have seen.

563
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:37,132
And then I come to this place
of my ancestors...

564
01:13:37,424 --> 01:13:39,426
...and I remember.

565
01:13:39,593 --> 01:13:41,928
Like these blossoms...

566
01:13:42,637 --> 01:13:44,681
...we are all dying.

567
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:50,019
To know life in every breath...

568
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,980
...every cup of tea...

569
01:13:53,147 --> 01:13:56,191
...every life we take.

570
01:13:56,358 --> 01:13:58,735
The way of the warrior.

571
01:13:58,902 --> 01:14:01,113
Life in every breath.

572
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:04,449
That is Bushido.

573
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:12,373
The Emperor has granted
a safe passage to Tokyo.

574
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,084
We leave tomorrow.

575
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:19,379
Good.

576
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:21,798
Good.

577
01:14:28,388 --> 01:14:31,349
When I took these, you were...

578
01:14:32,224 --> 01:14:33,809
...my enemy.

579
01:14:53,953 --> 01:14:55,996
Excuse me.

580
01:14:57,581 --> 01:15:00,792
No, so sorry, I am finishing.

581
01:15:18,684 --> 01:15:20,560
I must go away.

582
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:45,583
You have been kind to me.

583
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,463
I won't forget...

584
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,949
Algren-san! Algren-san.

585
01:19:15,192 --> 01:19:16,860
Algren?

586
01:19:17,027 --> 01:19:19,946
Algren, my God, you are alive.

587
01:19:24,034 --> 01:19:26,494
Well, you never cease to astonish.

588
01:19:27,203 --> 01:19:30,957
- Howitzers.
- Yes, indeed.

589
01:19:31,123 --> 01:19:33,918
As soon as the Emperor signs
the trade agreement...

590
01:19:34,084 --> 01:19:36,170
...he gets the whole package.

591
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:39,881
Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.

592
01:19:40,298 --> 01:19:43,510
And the new cartridges
cut down on jamming.

593
01:19:43,677 --> 01:19:45,428
I need a bath.

594
01:19:45,595 --> 01:19:49,182
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.

595
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:52,935
Welcome back, captain.

596
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:04,946
You rise against me, my teacher.

597
01:20:05,113 --> 01:20:08,157
No, Highness.
I rise against your enemies.

598
01:20:08,533 --> 01:20:12,453
They are my advisors, like you.

599
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:15,539
They advise in their own interest.

600
01:20:16,415 --> 01:20:21,211
I need advisors who know
the modern world.

601
01:20:21,962 --> 01:20:26,174
If I am no use,
I will happily end my life.

602
01:20:28,134 --> 01:20:29,635
No...

603
01:20:30,261 --> 01:20:33,139
I need your voice in the council.

604
01:20:33,389 --> 01:20:35,557
It is your voice we need, Highness.

605
01:20:36,392 --> 01:20:39,686
You are a living god.
Do what you think is right.

606
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,564
I am a living god...

607
01:20:44,065 --> 01:20:47,652
...as long as I do
what they think is right.

608
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:51,030
What sad words you speak.

609
01:20:51,405 --> 01:20:54,491
Forgive me for saying
what a teacher must.

610
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,078
Have you forgotten your people?

611
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:02,249
Tell me what to do...

612
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:05,960
...my teacher.

613
01:21:10,882 --> 01:21:13,551
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.

614
01:21:14,843 --> 01:21:18,889
You must find the wisdom for all of us.

615
01:21:23,893 --> 01:21:26,437
Gentlemen, come in.

616
01:21:26,938 --> 01:21:30,149
Captain Algren, it seems
you have endured your captivity...

617
01:21:30,316 --> 01:21:31,609
...with little ill effect.

618
01:21:32,568 --> 01:21:34,111
I was not ill-treated, sir.

619
01:21:34,278 --> 01:21:37,906
Mr. Omura, I have here
a draft of the arms agreement.

620
01:21:38,073 --> 01:21:41,868
I'm eager to know how many Samurai
have joined Katsumoto.

621
01:21:42,035 --> 01:21:43,453
I'm afraid I don't know.

622
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,998
- You spent the winter at his encampment.
- As his prisoner.

623
01:21:47,165 --> 01:21:51,419
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.

624
01:21:51,585 --> 01:21:56,924
As you said, colonel,
they're savages with bows and arrows.

625
01:21:57,091 --> 01:22:01,053
- Sir, about the-
- I'm sure your documents are in order.

626
01:22:01,219 --> 01:22:05,640
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.

627
01:22:05,807 --> 01:22:10,186
With all due respect, sir,
our president's patience is wearing thin.

628
01:22:10,353 --> 01:22:12,897
Perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

629
01:22:13,064 --> 01:22:15,441
With all due respect, ambassador...

630
01:22:15,608 --> 01:22:18,318
...perhaps there is someone else
we should speak to.

631
01:22:18,485 --> 01:22:21,279
For instance, the French
or the English.

632
01:22:21,446 --> 01:22:24,574
Or any of the legations
waiting in the next room.

633
01:22:26,284 --> 01:22:29,579
We should be looking forward
to hearing from you.

634
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:33,958
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.

635
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:39,254
Perhaps you and I might have
a word in private. Please, sit down.

636
01:22:42,299 --> 01:22:45,635
- May I offer you whiskey?
- No, thank you.

637
01:22:51,932 --> 01:22:55,102
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man,
is he not?

638
01:22:55,269 --> 01:22:58,981
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.

639
01:22:59,147 --> 01:23:04,110
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.

640
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:08,156
- I don't see how this concerns me.
- But it does.

641
01:23:08,322 --> 01:23:13,577
You see, you were right. Last year,
we were not prepared to go to battle.

642
01:23:13,744 --> 01:23:16,372
You were right,
and Colonel Bagley was wrong.

643
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:18,498
But now, we are ready.

644
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:22,085
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract
other Samurai to his cause...

645
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:27,090
...we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.

646
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:32,845
Either I'll stop him at the council today,
or you'll lead my army against him.

647
01:23:33,012 --> 01:23:37,141
And with these new weapons,
you will crush him.

648
01:23:38,934 --> 01:23:42,479
- I appreciate the offer.
- It is not an offer.

649
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:47,317
Mr. Omura, my contract with you
was to train your army.

650
01:23:47,483 --> 01:23:49,986
Then we will make a new contract...

651
01:23:50,153 --> 01:23:53,572
...one that will recognize
the extraordinary contribution...

652
01:23:53,739 --> 01:23:55,366
...you've made to the Emperor.

653
01:23:55,866 --> 01:23:58,160
Do we understand each other?

654
01:24:00,704 --> 01:24:04,666
- Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
- Then I am pleased.

655
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:17,052
Follow him. If he goes anywhere
near Katsumoto, kill him.

656
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:25,643
Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?

657
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:27,812
The diplomatic community is abuzz.

658
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,731
Omura has passed laws
against the Samurai.

659
01:24:30,898 --> 01:24:32,191
I need a drink.

660
01:24:32,358 --> 01:24:36,737
Is your friend Katsumoto planning to go
up against the council this afternoon?

661
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:43,201
You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?

662
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:45,036
My God, it's started.

663
01:24:45,411 --> 01:24:47,705
Hey boy, are you listening?

664
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:50,917
No wonder the foreigners mock you.

665
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:52,460
Let's give this Samurai a haircut.

666
01:24:52,752 --> 01:24:54,128
Cut off his top knot.

667
01:24:54,503 --> 01:24:55,796
Get down! Kneel!

668
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:57,005
Captain Algren!

669
01:24:57,172 --> 01:24:58,215
Lower your weapons!

670
01:24:59,132 --> 01:25:00,759
Lower your weapons!

671
01:25:02,135 --> 01:25:03,303
Who are you?

672
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:04,804
I am Captain Algren.

673
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:08,683
Stop!

674
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:34,248
Get down!

675
01:25:49,429 --> 01:25:51,222
Let's go.

676
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:09,780
I'll take you home.

677
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,533
Jolly good.

678
01:26:39,558 --> 01:26:41,601
We must resist the Western powers...

679
01:26:41,768 --> 01:26:43,561
...by becoming powerful ourselves.

680
01:26:44,354 --> 01:26:48,191
Our army, our economy,
must be strong.

681
01:26:51,694 --> 01:26:55,030
Minister, you honor us.

682
01:26:57,533 --> 01:27:00,077
It is my honor to rejoin this council.

683
01:27:05,415 --> 01:27:08,668
Perhaps you are unaware of the law
against wearing swords?

684
01:27:08,918 --> 01:27:10,962
I read every law carefully.

685
01:27:11,128 --> 01:27:14,590
Yet you bring weapons
into this chamber?

686
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:21,555
This chamber was protected
by my sword when-

687
01:27:21,721 --> 01:27:25,100
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.

688
01:27:25,266 --> 01:27:27,977
We are a nation of whores,
selling ourselves-

689
01:27:28,144 --> 01:27:32,356
If we are whores,
the Samurai made us this way.

690
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:37,361
I have not seen the Omura family
giving gold to the masses.

691
01:27:41,073 --> 01:27:43,950
Minister Katsumoto,
it is with great regret...

692
01:27:45,034 --> 01:27:47,495
...but I must ask you
to remove your sword.

693
01:27:51,999 --> 01:27:53,918
This sword serves the Emperor.

694
01:27:54,084 --> 01:27:56,670
Only he can command me to remove it.

695
01:28:19,274 --> 01:28:23,445
The Emperor's voice is too pure
to be heard in this council.

696
01:28:25,405 --> 01:28:28,991
Then, I must refuse
to give up my sword.

697
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:38,041
Then regretfully, my guards will
accompany you to your home in Tokyo.

698
01:28:38,208 --> 01:28:40,919
There you will await our summons.

699
01:29:05,066 --> 01:29:07,068
I heard you were leaving.

700
01:29:08,861 --> 01:29:11,906
Omura offers you my job,
and you run away.

701
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,200
I suppose I should thank you.

702
01:29:15,743 --> 01:29:20,288
$500 a month, including
back pay for time spent...

703
01:29:20,706 --> 01:29:22,541
...in captivity.

704
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:27,462
Enough to climb back inside a bottle
for the rest of your life.

705
01:29:30,881 --> 01:29:32,341
You're welcome.

706
01:29:37,513 --> 01:29:40,057
Well, it is pretty much over.

707
01:29:40,223 --> 01:29:44,602
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.

708
01:29:44,769 --> 01:29:49,148
With him dead, we should have
little trouble handling the rebellion...

709
01:29:49,315 --> 01:29:51,067
...even without you.

710
01:29:55,404 --> 01:29:57,739
Especially without you.

711
01:30:02,702 --> 01:30:04,913
Just tell me one thing.

712
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:09,792
What is it about your own people
that you hate so much?

713
01:31:02,257 --> 01:31:04,592
Save us the trouble...

714
01:33:54,623 --> 01:33:56,959
The Samurai are finished!

715
01:34:22,649 --> 01:34:23,942
Stop!

716
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:25,360
Don't come any closer!

717
01:34:25,527 --> 01:34:28,196
Don't stop.
Whatever you do, don't stop.

718
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:33,117
Minister Omura has commanded us
to photograph the traitor-

719
01:34:33,659 --> 01:34:35,160
Stop! Somebody!

720
01:34:35,577 --> 01:34:37,037
Bring that equipment here now!

721
01:34:37,204 --> 01:34:38,580
Immediately!

722
01:34:38,747 --> 01:34:40,499
You stop!

723
01:34:40,707 --> 01:34:44,836
You insolent, useless son
of a peasant dog!

724
01:34:46,754 --> 01:34:51,175
How dare you show your sword in
his presence! Do you know who this is?

725
01:34:51,384 --> 01:34:54,887
This is the President
of the United States of America!

726
01:34:55,179 --> 01:34:59,266
He is here to lead our armies
in victorious battle against the rebels!

727
01:34:59,433 --> 01:35:01,268
It's not my responsibility...

728
01:35:01,476 --> 01:35:05,146
Now get over there and
help those men with their equipment!

729
01:35:08,483 --> 01:35:09,984
Carry the equipment.

730
01:35:13,737 --> 01:35:16,865
- President of the United States?
- Sorry.

731
01:35:17,032 --> 01:35:18,825
I think I'm going to be sick.

732
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:39,094
How's your poem coming?

733
01:35:41,721 --> 01:35:44,599
The end is proving difficult.

734
01:35:44,766 --> 01:35:48,728
This is Mr. Simon Graham. He'd like
very much to take your photograph.

735
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:52,398
I thought you returned to America.

736
01:35:52,565 --> 01:35:57,236
I decided to stay.
See if I could convince you to escape.

737
01:35:57,486 --> 01:35:59,613
How do you plan to do that?

738
01:36:08,413 --> 01:36:12,416
Mr. Graham, perhaps you would care
to take pictures of my village.

739
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:14,793
I would be greatly honored.

740
01:37:35,242 --> 01:37:37,286
My Lord, no!

741
01:37:38,203 --> 01:37:39,538
Nobutada!

742
01:38:24,537 --> 01:38:27,373
Father, let me stay.

743
01:38:31,419 --> 01:38:33,170
It is my time.

744
01:38:46,516 --> 01:38:47,892
My Lord...

745
01:38:48,601 --> 01:38:50,478
...we must go.

746
01:40:13,304 --> 01:40:16,181
The Emperor could not hear my words.

747
01:40:18,517 --> 01:40:21,019
His army will come.

748
01:40:22,312 --> 01:40:24,230
It is the end.

749
01:40:26,691 --> 01:40:31,237
For 900 years, my ancestors
have protected our people.

750
01:40:32,905 --> 01:40:35,157
Now...

751
01:40:35,324 --> 01:40:37,034
...I have failed them.

752
01:40:48,586 --> 01:40:52,006
So you will take your own life...

753
01:40:53,549 --> 01:40:54,842
...in shame?

754
01:41:00,013 --> 01:41:03,683
Shame for a life of service?

755
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,478
Discipline? Compassion?

756
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:11,732
The way of the Samurai
is not necessary anymore.

757
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:14,360
Necessary?

758
01:41:16,362 --> 01:41:18,864
What could be more necessary?

759
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:26,496
I will die by the sword.

760
01:41:28,206 --> 01:41:30,625
My own...

761
01:41:30,791 --> 01:41:32,626
...or my enemy's.

762
01:41:33,794 --> 01:41:35,921
Then let it be your enemy's.

763
01:41:39,549 --> 01:41:43,345
Together, we will make
the Emperor hear you.

764
01:42:11,078 --> 01:42:14,873
He was a good man.

765
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:20,295
Will you fight the white men, too?

766
01:42:20,545 --> 01:42:25,925
If they come here, yes.

767
01:42:27,969 --> 01:42:29,387
Why?

768
01:42:32,139 --> 01:42:39,271
Because they come to destroy
what I have come to love.

769
01:42:50,823 --> 01:42:58,956
The way of Samurai is difficult
for children. He misses his father.

770
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:08,756
And he is angry
because I am the cause of that.

771
01:43:13,052 --> 01:43:19,308
No. He is angry because
he fears you will die as well.

772
01:43:39,868 --> 01:43:44,789
My father taught me
it is glorious to die in battle.

773
01:43:49,210 --> 01:43:55,799
That is what he believed.

774
01:43:59,011 --> 01:44:01,054
I would be afraid to die in battle.

775
01:44:02,764 --> 01:44:04,224
So would I.

776
01:44:06,434 --> 01:44:08,936
But you have been in many battles.

777
01:44:10,896 --> 01:44:13,983
And I was always afraid.

778
01:44:21,698 --> 01:44:23,033
I don't want you to go.

779
01:44:24,534 --> 01:44:26,411
Algren.

780
01:44:26,578 --> 01:44:27,870
They are coming.

781
01:44:57,189 --> 01:44:59,274
I'd say two full regiments.

782
01:44:59,441 --> 01:45:01,735
They'll come in waves of a thousand.

783
01:45:02,277 --> 01:45:03,903
And they have the howitzers.

784
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:08,324
It makes no difference. They will come,
and we will make our stand.

785
01:45:08,491 --> 01:45:11,535
- How many men will we have?
- Maybe 500.

786
01:45:12,119 --> 01:45:13,913
Like General Custer, huh?

787
01:45:18,250 --> 01:45:22,254
There was once a battle
at a place called Thermopylae.

788
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:26,007
Three hundred brave Greeks held off
a Persian army of a million men.

789
01:45:26,174 --> 01:45:28,760
A million. You understand this number?

790
01:45:28,926 --> 01:45:30,928
I understand this number.

791
01:45:31,178 --> 01:45:33,764
For two days the Greeks
made them pay so dearly...

792
01:45:33,931 --> 01:45:39,269
...the Persian army lost all taste
for battle and were defeated soon after.

793
01:45:39,436 --> 01:45:43,606
- What do you have in mind?
- Take away the advantage of their guns.

794
01:45:43,815 --> 01:45:47,318
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.

795
01:45:48,486 --> 01:45:50,071
Close enough for a sword.

796
01:45:51,781 --> 01:45:54,074
You believe...

797
01:45:54,241 --> 01:45:56,326
...a man can change his destiny?

798
01:45:59,288 --> 01:46:02,457
I think a man does what he can...

799
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,751
...until his destiny is revealed to him.

800
01:46:12,133 --> 01:46:15,803
May 25th, 1877.

801
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:19,139
This will be the last entry
in this journal.

802
01:46:19,306 --> 01:46:24,519
I've tried to give a true accounting
of what I have seen, what I have done.

803
01:46:24,686 --> 01:46:28,272
I do not presume to understand
the course of my life.

804
01:46:28,606 --> 01:46:32,651
I know I am grateful
to have partaken of all this...

805
01:46:32,818 --> 01:46:34,862
...even if for a moment.

806
01:48:27,048 --> 01:48:31,886
Algren-san, will you come with me?

807
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:52,405
If you wear this armor,
it will honor us.

808
01:51:50,693 --> 01:51:53,571
You will need this.

809
01:52:05,415 --> 01:52:06,708
What does it say?

810
01:52:07,792 --> 01:52:13,297
"I belong to the warrior in whom
the old ways have joined the new."

811
01:53:17,314 --> 01:53:19,858
Good God.

812
01:53:23,361 --> 01:53:27,407
Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan
demands your surrender.

813
01:53:27,865 --> 01:53:30,451
If you lay down your arms,
you will not be harmed.

814
01:53:30,785 --> 01:53:35,331
This is not possible,
as Mr. Omura knows.

815
01:53:39,501 --> 01:53:41,419
Captain Algren.

816
01:53:41,586 --> 01:53:43,505
We will show you no quarter.

817
01:53:43,672 --> 01:53:46,341
You ride against us,
and you are the same as them.

818
01:53:47,342 --> 01:53:49,385
I'll look for you on the field.

819
01:54:10,154 --> 01:54:11,614
Captain Algren.

820
01:54:11,781 --> 01:54:14,408
Mr. Graham.

821
01:54:17,703 --> 01:54:21,081
Perhaps you can use these
for your book.

822
01:54:21,248 --> 01:54:23,667
Yes, I will. Captain.

823
01:54:26,836 --> 01:54:28,588
Godspeed.

824
01:54:30,214 --> 01:54:32,591
Mr. Graham.

825
01:54:56,447 --> 01:54:59,324
Well they won't surrender.

826
01:55:04,829 --> 01:55:07,790
Are we ready?

827
01:55:09,667 --> 01:55:11,043
Get into your positions!

828
01:55:55,459 --> 01:55:58,253
Commence firing!

829
01:57:14,114 --> 01:57:16,700
- They're covering their retreat.
- You see?

830
01:57:16,867 --> 01:57:20,620
Even the mighty Samurai
cannot stand up to the howitzers.

831
01:57:20,787 --> 01:57:23,998
- Signal the attack.
- I advise sending in skirmishers first.

832
01:57:24,165 --> 01:57:26,167
Nonsense! Full attack!

833
01:58:21,885 --> 01:58:24,137
They're coming.

834
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:58,377
Wait for the volley.

835
01:59:10,179 --> 01:59:12,014
Second volley.

836
02:00:06,773 --> 02:00:09,066
- What on earth?
- What is happening?

837
02:00:53,858 --> 02:00:57,194
- The attack has been stopped.
- Send in the rest of the regiment.

838
02:01:02,157 --> 02:01:04,451
What happened to the warriors
at Thermopylae?

839
02:01:04,826 --> 02:01:07,620
Dead to the last man.

840
02:02:10,678 --> 02:02:12,430
Algren-san!

841
02:05:00,917 --> 02:05:03,753
Son of a bitch thinks he can win.

842
02:06:07,979 --> 02:06:11,899
They'll bring two more regiments
up here soon.

843
02:06:12,066 --> 02:06:14,109
We won't be able to stop them again.

844
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:17,196
You do not have to die here.

845
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:22,993
I should have died
so many times before.

846
02:06:23,535 --> 02:06:24,953
Now, you live again.

847
02:06:28,206 --> 02:06:30,416
Yes.

848
02:06:32,585 --> 02:06:35,546
It was not your time.

849
02:06:38,924 --> 02:06:41,218
It's not over.

850
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:28,928
What is this?

851
02:07:29,095 --> 02:07:30,638
Cannon, prepare to fire!

852
02:07:31,013 --> 02:07:32,515
Prepare to fire!

853
02:07:33,182 --> 02:07:37,519
- This is madness. He's going to attack?
- Yes.

854
02:07:45,818 --> 02:07:48,863
He's defeated!
He must accept his shame!

855
02:08:00,832 --> 02:08:03,251
Kill him. All of them.

856
02:08:03,418 --> 02:08:05,837
Now!

857
02:08:09,882 --> 02:08:11,217
My horse!

858
02:09:04,140 --> 02:09:05,433
Fire!

859
02:09:42,425 --> 02:09:43,760
Ready!

860
02:09:47,138 --> 02:09:48,431
Aim!

861
02:09:53,769 --> 02:09:55,104
Fire!

862
02:10:01,276 --> 02:10:02,777
Fire at will!

863
02:10:48,945 --> 02:10:50,905
Bring up the new guns!

864
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:52,990
Prepare the new guns!

865
02:10:57,953 --> 02:10:59,788
Fire!

866
02:11:01,831 --> 02:11:03,166
Backward!

867
02:11:06,169 --> 02:11:08,337
Quickly! Quickly!

868
02:11:11,841 --> 02:11:13,425
Fire!

869
02:12:58,021 --> 02:12:59,439
Stop firing!

870
02:12:59,773 --> 02:13:01,608
Idiots, keep on firing!

871
02:13:01,775 --> 02:13:03,443
Stop firing! Stop!

872
02:13:13,118 --> 02:13:14,578
No.

873
02:13:15,954 --> 02:13:19,499
Shoot! Kill Katsumoto!
Kill the American!

874
02:13:21,668 --> 02:13:24,421
You have your honor again.

875
02:13:26,631 --> 02:13:28,883
Let me die with mine.

876
02:13:38,308 --> 02:13:40,310
Help me up.

877
02:13:59,911 --> 02:14:01,621
Are you ready?

878
02:14:08,753 --> 02:14:12,423
I will miss our conversations.

879
02:14:58,966 --> 02:15:01,301
Perfect.

880
02:15:07,890 --> 02:15:11,102
They are all...

881
02:15:12,103 --> 02:15:14,229
...perfect.

882
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:45,980
On behalf of the United States
of America...

883
02:16:46,898 --> 02:16:52,153
...the signing of this treaty will usher in
an era of unprecedented prosperity...

884
02:16:52,319 --> 02:16:56,448
...and cooperation between
our two great nations.

885
02:16:56,782 --> 02:16:58,492
On behalf of the Emperor...

886
02:16:58,659 --> 02:17:02,454
...we are pleased to have
successfully concluded this...

887
02:17:05,832 --> 02:17:08,126
...negotiation.

888
02:17:15,758 --> 02:17:17,509
He is here?

889
02:18:21,943 --> 02:18:24,821
Highness, if we could just conclude
the matter at hand...

890
02:18:52,304 --> 02:18:55,140
This is Katsumoto's sword.

891
02:18:56,475 --> 02:18:59,186
He would have wanted you to have it...

892
02:19:00,353 --> 02:19:03,440
...that the strength of the Samurai
be with you always.

893
02:19:04,315 --> 02:19:09,278
Enlightened One,
we all weep for Katsumoto, but-

894
02:19:09,487 --> 02:19:11,072
He hoped...

895
02:19:11,697 --> 02:19:13,908
...with his last breath...

896
02:19:14,283 --> 02:19:17,661
...that you would remember the
ancestors who held this sword...

897
02:19:19,454 --> 02:19:21,748
...and what they died for.

898
02:19:23,124 --> 02:19:24,918
Your Highness...

899
02:19:41,975 --> 02:19:44,185
You were with him...

900
02:19:45,353 --> 02:19:47,438
...at the end?

901
02:19:52,818 --> 02:19:56,280
Emperor, this man fought against you!

902
02:20:00,492 --> 02:20:02,118
Your Highness...

903
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:07,957
...if you believe me to be your enemy,
command me...

904
02:20:08,124 --> 02:20:10,418
...and I will gladly take my life.

905
02:20:24,556 --> 02:20:28,643
I have dreamed of a unified Japan...

906
02:20:28,810 --> 02:20:34,606
...of a country strong
and independent and modern.

907
02:20:34,773 --> 02:20:40,570
And now we have railroads
and cannon, Western clothing.

908
02:20:42,530 --> 02:20:44,157
But...

909
02:20:47,535 --> 02:20:51,580
...we cannot forget who we are...

910
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:57,544
...or where we come from.

911
02:21:09,931 --> 02:21:12,516
Ambassador Swanbeck...

912
02:21:12,683 --> 02:21:15,519
...I have concluded that your treaty...

913
02:21:15,686 --> 02:21:20,524
...is not in the best interest
of my people.

914
02:21:21,274 --> 02:21:24,903
- Sir, if I may-
- So sorry...

915
02:21:25,278 --> 02:21:27,071
...but you may not.

916
02:21:27,405 --> 02:21:30,741
This is an outrage!

917
02:21:36,747 --> 02:21:38,206
Enlightened One,
we should discuss this-

918
02:21:38,373 --> 02:21:39,750
Omura...

919
02:21:39,916 --> 02:21:42,085
...you have done quite enough.

920
02:21:42,335 --> 02:21:44,963
Everything I have done,
I have done for my country.

921
02:21:45,129 --> 02:21:48,091
Then you will not mind
when I seize your family's assets...

922
02:21:48,341 --> 02:21:50,926
...and present them
as my gift to the people.

923
02:21:51,093 --> 02:21:53,429
You disgrace me.

924
02:21:53,637 --> 02:21:55,681
If your shame is too unbearable...

925
02:22:05,064 --> 02:22:06,524
...I offer you this sword.

926
02:22:37,302 --> 02:22:39,846
Tell me how he died.

927
02:22:47,603 --> 02:22:52,149
I will tell you how he lived.

928
02:23:01,408 --> 02:23:05,828
And so the days
of the Samurai had ended.

929
02:23:05,995 --> 02:23:11,542
Nations, like men, it is sometimes said,
have their own destiny.

930
02:23:12,626 --> 02:23:15,212
As for the American captain...

931
02:23:15,379 --> 02:23:17,714
...no one knows what became of him.

932
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:21,343
Some say that he died of his wounds...

933
02:23:21,509 --> 02:23:25,471
...others, that he returned
to his own country.

934
02:23:25,638 --> 02:23:27,265
But I like to think...

935
02:23:27,432 --> 02:23:32,520
...he may have at last found
some small measure of peace...

936
02:23:32,686 --> 02:23:34,688
...that we all seek...

937
02:23:35,439 --> 02:23:38,608
...and few of us ever find.
